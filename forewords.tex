\section[Welcome message]{Welcome message from the Dean of Engineering at Kyushu University, Prof. Yoshio Hisaeda}

I am delighted to welcome you to the 5th UK-Japan Engineering Education League Workshop, held for the first time at Kyushu University. Given the long history of collaboration between the UK and Japan in fields of engineering education and research which extends back more than 100 years, this event represents a important continuation of this tradition for current and future generations of scientists.
 
The Faculty of Engineering in Kyushu University is the fourth oldest faculty among Japanese universities, and was founded as the College of Engineering of Kyushu Imperial University in 1911. Since that time, as one of the key faculties of the leading universities in Japan, the faculty has contributed to the development of engineering, technology and industry, providing leading research and enhanced engineering education. This year is particularly momentous: the ceremony to celebrate completion of our new campus ``Ito Campus'' is being held this September.

I wish you all a fruitful time at this workshop and a pleasant stay around Kyushu University and the wider Fukuoka region.
