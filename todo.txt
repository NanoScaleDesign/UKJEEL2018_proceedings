Major issues
--------------

1) Design front cover

2) Sort out arrangement of programme 

3)Organis

3) List of participants needs to be inserted
(File/ Format already created)

4) Need description of Kyushu University
(File/ Format already created)

5) DO we also need a brief summary of UKJEEL ?
When was the first, where previous ones have been held,
what sort of content, what is the basic aim ?

6)Need details of Tours inserted

7) List of abstracts
- file/format created , just need to insert real data


---------------------------
Minor Issues

1) SLightly reduce the size of 'Contents' in the table of contents?
 (or increase the size of the sectional headings). Problem has arisen 
 because we are using 'book' template but do not have chapters

2) Organising committee
  - DO we have everyone ? How about Yasuda sensei ? Also there
 was a female assoc. prof. (can't remember her name unfortunately) -anyone else?

3) Is the group photo (see programme) before or after lunch ?


4) Are there any abstracts for main speakers?  


5) Consider putting background block colours into programme
 for easy comprehension. e.g. light pink for all participants,
 light blue for students only , light yellow for faculty only

6) (For pdf version) customize hyperlinking
